# ChatGPT Coffee and Code Workshop Materials. 

This two workshop series focused on ChatGPT provides an introduction to ChatGPT setup and use, both through the web interface and programmatically through use of the OpenAI Application Programming Interface, with examples provided in R and Python. 

Workshop 1 focuses on the web interface and practice in prompt engineering to support programming work. In this workshop we will be using the online ChatGPT interface provided here: https://chat.openai.com/auth/login. In order to use the web interface you will need to sign up (using your email address, a Microsoft account, a Google account, or an Apple account. 

Workshop 2 focuses on extending the web-based practice introduced in Workshop 1 into using the OpenAI ChatGPT Application Programming Interface (API), including an overview of API concepts, creating and submitting requests to the API, and handling responses from the API. To use the OpenAI Platform API you will need to obtain an API key that is linked with your OpenAI account (created as part of Workshop 1). OpenAI's Developer Quickstart page provides instructions for getting set up to start using the OpenAI API. https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart
